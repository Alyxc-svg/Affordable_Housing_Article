        Affordable housing creation is on an uptick, but its placement in New York City is far from equal across all boroughs. A new bill from The City Council is looking to change that.

            <p> It’s no secret that affordable housing in New York is hard to find, but it’s even harder to find when it isn't built everywhere. A recent study of Housing Preservation and Development department data shows affordable units built in the past decade are heavily concentrated in Brooklyn and the Bronx.(See Graph Below)

                    In an effort to combat this <a href="https://www.huduser.gov/portal/periodicals/em/winter11/highlight2.html#:~:text=Neighborhoods%20of%20concentrated%20poverty%20isolate,of%20the%20neighborhood's%20human%20capital."target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">concentration of poverty</a> , New York City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams passed <a href="https://council.nyc.gov/press/2023/11/15/2503/"target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" >Introduction 1031-A</a> on November 15th. It sets five-year goals for the production and preservation of affordable units across the city but notably lacks any mandates for production.
                    Comparing mandated and unmandated affordable housing projects in the cities past shows a 10.6% difference in the yearly average locations created.(See Graph 2)</p>

                    <p>In response to questions about the efficacy of this Bill, New York City Council member and signee on the Bill Pierina Sanchez said  “I just want to point us to the history of planning in the region, it has been conducted by civic groups. Those plans although they were not required and there were no sticks. They came into play when there was government funding available.”
